mso-ascii-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:
major-bidi;mso-bidi-language:AR-EG">Modern computer performance is often 
described in instructions per cycle (IPC), which measures the efficiency of the 
architecture at any clock frequency; a faster IPC rate means the computer is 
faster. Older computers had IPC counts as low as 0.1 while modern processors 
easily reach near 1. Superscalar processors may reach three to five IPC by 
executing several instructions per clock cycle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ascii-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:
major-bidi;mso-bidi-language:AR-EG">Counting machine-language instructions would 
be misleading because they can do varying amounts of work in different ISAs. The 
"instruction" in the standard measurements is not a count of the ISA's 
machine-language instructions, but a unit of measurement, usually based on the 
speed of the VAX computer architecture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ascii-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:
major-bidi;mso-bidi-language:AR-EG">Many people used to measure a computer's 
speed by the clock rate (usually in MHz or GHz). This refers to the cycles per 
second of the main clock of the CPU. However, this metric is somewhat 
misleading, as a machine with a higher clock rate may not necessarily have 
greater performance. As a result, manufacturers have moved away from clock speed 
as a measure of performance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ascii-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:
major-bidi;mso-bidi-language:AR-EG">Other factors influence speed, such as the 
mix of functional units, bus speeds, available memory, and the type and order of 
instructions in the programs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ascii-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:
major-bidi;mso-bidi-language:AR-EG">There are two main types of speed: latency 
and throughput. Latency is the time between the start of a process and its 
completion. Throughput is the amount of work done per unit time. Interrupt 
latency is the guaranteed maximum response time of the system to an electronic 
event (like when the disk drive finishes moving some data). <o:p></o:p></span>

mso-ascii-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:
major-bidi;mso-bidi-language:AR-EG">Performance is affected by a very wide range 
of design choices â€” for example, pipelining a processor usually makes latency 
worse, but makes throughput better. Computers that control machinery usually 
need low interrupt latencies. These computers operate in a real-time environment 
and fail if an operation is not completed in a specified amount of time. For 
example, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes must begin braking within a 
predictable and limited time period after the brake pedal is sensed or else 
failure of the brake will occur. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ascii-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-bidi;mso-bidi-theme-font:
major-bidi;mso-bidi-language:AR-EG">Benchmarking takes all these factors into 
account by measuring the time a computer takes to run through a series of test 
programs. Although benchmarking shows strengths, it shouldn't be how you choose 
a computer. Often the measured machines split on different measures. For 
example, one system might handle scientific applications quickly, while another 
might render video games more smoothly. Furthermore, designers may target and 
add special features to their products, through hardware or software, that 
permit a specific benchmark to execute quickly but don't offer similar 
advantages to general tasks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
